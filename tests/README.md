Futhark Integration Test Suite
==============================

This directory contains a large number of small programs that test the
Futhark compiler itself.  You should not assume that these programs
are examples of good Futhark style, nor that they are written to be
understandable.  Many are from very early days, when the language was
much different, and have been semi-mechanically updated.  Others are
intentionally ugly to test out some corner case of the compiler.  Look
at the [example
programs](https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark/tree/master/examples) or
the [benchmark suite](https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-benchmarks/)
if you want examples to learn from.
